Create a clean, structured **LaTeX educational summary** based strictly on the transcript.

The final document must be written in **{{ language }}**.

Guidelines:
- Use ONLY facts from the transcript as the base.
- You MAY add explanations, but they MUST appear in designated blocks.
- Do NOT reference the transcript or the speaker.
- Maintain the speaker`s logical order.
- Produce academically clear, structured LaTeX text.
- Quotes must be accurate and <= 25 words.

Use the structure below.  
Assume that stylistic environments are already defined in the `.sty` file.

\section*{ {{ title }} }

\subsection*{Key Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item main idea
\item …
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Core Concepts and Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Term}] definition
\item[\textbf{Another Term}] definition
\end{description}

\subsection*{Detailed Summary}
Write a clear, logically structured academic explanation.  
Break content into paragraphs, subsections, lists.

Quotes from the transcript must be included as:

\begin{quote}
"{{ quote }}"
\end{quote}

(Ensure each quote is ≤ 25 words.)

\subsection*{Examples and Explanations}

Examples based on the transcript.

Additional clarifications must use the following custom environment (assumed to exist in the .sty):

\begin{aiclarification}
Your additional explanation, analogy, or contextual expansion.
\end{aiclarification}

Short notes should use:

\ainote{short clarification}

\subsection*{Conclusions and Key Insights}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Self-Assessment Questions}
